KEYWORDS
    as - denote a type or converts value of 1 type to another

TYPES
    natnum - Natural Number, positive whole numbers
    int - Integers, whole numbers
    ratnum - Rational Number, whole numbers and fractions
    irratnum - Irrational Number, example: pi, sqrt(2)
    realnum - Real numbers, any numbers

DATA_TYPES
    natnum - Natural numbers, stored as a unsigned integer
        type - natnum
    int - Integers, stored as a 32bit integer
        type = int
    frac - Fractions, stored as fraction expressions
        type = ratnum
    decimal - Numbers that may have decimals, stored as float or double
        type = ratnum
    irratnum - Irrational numbers, stored as expressions
        type = irratnum

INSTRUCTIONS
    in - input as argument when executing the .calc file
        type - the type of input, from TYPES
        min - minimum value of input
        max - maximum value of input
    print - print a value
    graph - given a function graph it to a png file that will output to the .calc file directory
        stepx (realnum) - the step on the x axis 
            default = 1
        stepy - the step on the y axis
            default = 1
        minx - the left side of the x axis
            default = -10
        maxx - the right side of the x axis
            default = 110
        miny - the bottom of the y axis
            default = -10
        maxy - the top of the y axis
            default = 110
    out - the output of the .calc file, each file can only have 1 out instruction
    use - imports .calc file as a function that can be used in the current .calc file

CONCEPTS
    constants - values that can be an expression and are evaluated when used
    functions - an expression with a name and input(s) that yields a single output
    arguments - indented under INSTRUCTIONS to provided specifications to a instruction
    instructions - a instruction that does something specific, may or may not have argument(s)
    .calc files - .calc files that has a out instruction can be treated as a function
